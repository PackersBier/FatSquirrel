# CONTRIBUTING
This project uses the [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) workflow to manage  
working on several features/changes simultaneously.  
**If you do want to contribute to the code base act accordingly!**

## Tips & Tricks
A very important factor which contributes greatly to code-quality is a the **consistent** use of (naming) conventions.  
In order to automatically push *clean code*, I do recommend the use of the git-integration of IntelliJ.

If you do encounter a bug in the game mechanics (like a squirrel walking through a wall) -  do not hesitate to create an issue and structure the issue like  
the following:
